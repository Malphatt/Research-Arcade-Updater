# Research-Arcade-Updater
 A WPF App for the University of Lincoln Research Arcade Machines.
## Setup
  Edit the Config.json file to your liking, the template file looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "ApiHost": "https://example.com",
    "ApiUser": "ExampleUsername",
    "ApiPass": "ExamplePassword",
    "NoInputTimeout_ms": 120000,
  }
  ```
  If you leave it this way, it will probably crash, I didn't test it because I'm a professional.
